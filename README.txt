Hi there!

This program is based on some things I learned in CBT therapy. I am not a medical or psychological professional, I'm just a woman with some basic HTML programming skills. Please seek psychological assistance if you feel it's right for you.

If you're interested in getting in touch, you can contact me at rosemary.giuseppina@gmail.com. Please put "ohno" somewhere in the subject field so I don't filter you for spam.

Stay well,

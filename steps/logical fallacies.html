	<p>can you think of a counterargument to the things catboy ben shapiro was saying? were there any logical fallacies? what brain filters was his perspective warped by? think of at least two ways his thinking was faulty.</p>
	<p>here's a list of logical fallacies if you need them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ad hominem (attacking the person, not the argument)</li>
		<li>strawman (attacking an argument or person that doesn't exist)</li>
		<li>slippery slope (asserting that because of x, y <em>must</em> happen</li>
		<li>false dilemma (only giving yourself two options, when there are probably more)</li>
		<li>hasty generalisation (concluding something based on weak or biased evidence)</li>
		<li>argument from ignorance (something must be true because it hasn't been proven false)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>and here's a list of brain filters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>black and white thinking</li>
		<li>trying to predict the future</li>
		<li>saying "should" or "must"</li>
		<li>noticing failures but not successes, or vice versa</li>
		<li>calling yourself names</li>
		<li>over generalising (saying "never" or "always")</li>
		<li>disqualifying positives</li>
		<li>blaming yourself for things that aren't your fault</li>
		<li>jumping to conclusions</li>
		<li>trying to read minds</li>	
	</ul>
